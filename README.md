## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### 1. DialogFlow ES 💬 
DialogFlow is a Conversational AI platform provided by Google Cloud. It serves as the backbone for our chat assistant, enabling natural language interactions.

Utilizing the Google Inline Editor as a webhook helps manage API calls to generate responses dynamically based on data and complete ticket bookings. 

Note: DialogFlow requires credentials and keys, which are not exposed on GitHub for security reasons.

### 2. Flutter 📱 
Flutter powers the creation of the app, seamlessly translating the data received from DialogFlow into UI objects. 

### 3. mockapi.io 🗂️ 
This is an example application, and utilises dummy data. Mockapi.io was used to facilitate the creation of mock apis.
